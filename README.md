# Rust-HTTP-Server
Project for Learning Rust 🦀
- basic HTTP/1.1 server implementation
- reads and writes to TcpStream
- parses incoming requests into custom data types (listed below)
- serves arbitrary file types and checks for directory traversal attacks :)
- custom implementations for creating and parsing:
  - requests, responses, status codes, query strings, method types...
